                <h3>Why fit in when you <span>were born to stand out?</span></h3>
                <p>Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a common neurotype that is usually first diagnosed during childhood, though diagnoses in adults have surged in the past few years. More than six million children in the U.S. between the ages of 3 and 17 have been diagnosed with ADHD.</p>
                <p>It is characterized by patterns of inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity that make it difficult for people to function in a way that's deemed "standard" or neurotypical.</p>
                <p>ADHD is lifelong. While traits do change with time, they can still interfere with an adult's functioning. Relationships, health, work, and finances are just a few areas that may be impacted. There are management options, including medications and therapies, as well as helpful strategies that can help you live well with ADHD.</p>

                <h3>Anxiety is the <span>hand maiden of creativity</span></h3>
                <p>Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is a specific type of anxiety disorder. Most people worry at times about their health, job, money, or family, but people with GAD experience anxiety about these things and more, in a way that is persistent, excessive, and intrusive.</p>
                <p>They may experience physical symptoms including restlessness, sweating, difficulty swallowing, and using the restroom a lot. While symptoms of anxiety can be debilitating, with proper treatment—including medication and psychotherapy—people can learn to manage their symptoms and live a more productive life.</p>
